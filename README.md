# GladiusEx - Cataclysm

The famous and (imo, far superior) arena frame AddOn GladiusEx, now for Cataclysm!

## Installing

The folder "GladiusExBackport-Cata-master must be renamed to "GladiusEx" and placed in /Interface/AddOns (relative the WoW root folder).

### Note

The "Incoming" Absorb/Heal portion of the healthbar module has been removed as the underlying API is bugged (heals) / non-existant (absorbs) in Cataclysm.

At this time the interrupt module does not work.

### Disclaimer

The backport has not been widely tested and may contain serious bugs, if you choose to use the AddOn and find any such bugs please report them to me by creating an "issue" in https://github.com/ManneN1/GladiusExBackport-Cata/issues/new.

What little testing has been done, has been done on "WoWMortals" Destiny 85 Realm.
